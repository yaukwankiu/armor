#   localFeaturesValidationTest.py
#   to test the matching algorithm via local features
#   1.  load the COMPREF and WRF respectively
#   2.  construct local features after segmentation
#   3.  order local features according to volume, descending
#   4.  match the local features in COMPREF and WRF and compute the distances via the greedy algorithm
#   5.  compute the weighed distance between two images
#   6.  look for the closest WRF match to the COMPREF
#   7.  validation of the above algorithm
